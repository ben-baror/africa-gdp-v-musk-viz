## ðŸ“Š Visualisation
![Elon Africa viz](elon_africa.png)

This project maps African countries whose 2023 GDP surpasses Elon Muskâ€™s estimated net worth. 
While the comparison is imperfect, it is indicative enough for the purpose of this exercise, aiming to convey a sense of scale rather than precise figures. 
It is a hands-on exercise in collecting, cleaning, and merging data, as well as visualizing geographic information using Python and GeoPandas.
